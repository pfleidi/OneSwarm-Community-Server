OneSwarm Community Server
http://oneswarm.cs.washington.edu/

This is the reference implementation of the OneSwarm Community Server, which supports file publishing and friend list exchange among users of the OneSwarm P2P software client. 

Dependencies:
- Sun's Java 6 runtime -- http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
- MySQL (we've tested with 5.0.77 and 5.1.8) -- http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

Getting started requires: 
1) Installing MySQL
2) Seting a mysql password: mysqladmin -u root password yournewpassword
3) Creating the database:  mysql -u root --password=yournewpassword -e 'CREATE DATABASE community_db;'
3) Modifying the sample-communtiy.conf (to include your database info, as well as your SSL certificate if you are using SSL)
4) (Potentially) changing the JAVA_HOME variable in the start-* script for your platform
5) Running the start script with your configuration file as an argument
